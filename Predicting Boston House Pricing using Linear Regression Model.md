## Goal of the Project

In this project, we will evaluate the performance and predictive power of a model that has been trained and tested on data collected from homes in the suburbs of Boston,
Massachusetts. A model trained on this data that is seen as a good fit could then be used to make certain predictions about a home — in particular, its monetary value.

## About the Dataset:

* The Boston housing data was collected in 1978 and each of the 506 entries represents aggregated data about 14 features for homes from various suburbs in Boston,
  Massachusetts.
* First we have to explore the dataset and get to know about each data point and what they are related to.

### Below are the 14 features that we are going to consider from the dataset:
We can see that the input attributes have a mixture of units.

* ZN: proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq. ft.
* INDUS: proportion of non-retail business acres per town
* CHAS: Charles River dummy variable (= 1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)
* NOX: nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)
* RM: average number of rooms per dwelling
* AGE: proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940
* DIS: weighted distances to ﬁve Boston employment centers
* RAD: index of accessibility to radial highways
* TAX: full-value property-tax rate per $10,000
* PTRATIO: pupil-teacher ratio by town 12. B: 1000(Bk−0.63)2 where Bk is the proportion of blacks by town 13. LSTAT: % lower status of the population
* MEDV: Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000s
